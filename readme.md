# Piper neural voices for NVDA

This add-on implements a speech synthesizer driver for NVDA using [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper).

[Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) is a fast, local neural text to speech system that sounds great and is optimized for low-end devices such as the Raspberry Pi.

You can listen to voice samples here: [Piper voice samples](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/).
